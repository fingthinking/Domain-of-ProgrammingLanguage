# JavaScript 中的异常处理

# Promise 与事件中的异常

```sh
(node:48446) UnhandledPromiseRejectionWarning: This is fine
(node:48446) UnhandledPromiseRejectionWarning: Unhandled promise rejection. This error originated either by throwing inside of an async function without a catch block, or by rejecting a promise which was not handled with .catch(). (rejection id: 1)
(node:48446) [DEP0018] DeprecationWarning: Unhandled promise rejections are deprecated. In the future, promise rejections that are not handled will terminate the Node.js process with a non-zero exit code.
```

The process doesn’t crash. The process continues to work. But you get noticed. However, this behavior will change in the future! In future versions of Node.js the process will crash.

```js
process.on('unhandledRejection', (reason, promise) => {
  console.log('Unhandled Rejection at:', reason.stack || reason);
  // Recommended: send the information to sentry.io
  // or whatever crash reporting service you use
});
```

For promises rejected with an error (e.g. Promise.reject(new Error('This is fine'))) this will print both the message and the stack trace. In any other case this will print the object passed to reject the promise. So, it is important to always reject with an error object in order to get a stack trace!

```js
const fs = require('fs');
const stream = fs.createReadStream('do-not-exists.txt')

// Output
events.js:137
      throw er; // Unhandled 'error' event
      ^
Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, open 'do-not-exists.txt'
```

Always handle promise rejections. Listen to unhandled rejection events for crash reporting. And always use errors to reject promises in order to get stack traces!

Always handle the error event for streams!
Wrap JSON.parse() and any\*Sync() function in a

try-catch block or inside a Promise. Well, in general any function that can throw errors.
